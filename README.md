Car Window Tint  Checking Tool

  Tntr is an Android application for checking the amount of tint on a given car window, and to achieve this goal we utilized Android’s Light Sensor. The primary purpose behind it was to measure the legality of a car window’s tint in any given state. Since not all laws are the same across state lines, this application would serve travelers, professionals and consumers that utilize tints on their cars the chance to avoid confrontation with the law, or assure themselves that the tint to be applied meets both the advertised tint and doesn’t violate state laws.
